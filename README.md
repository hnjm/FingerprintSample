# FingerprintSample

## Why this Sample?

1. Unlike [android-FingerprintDialog](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-FingerprintDialog), this sample demonstrates how to decrypt data when I create this repo.
2. This sample has **0** library dependencies
3. Just **~100** lines of code for core encryption/decryption parts
